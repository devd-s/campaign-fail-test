## Issue Analysis

        ISSUE: [AWS] API Gateway Elevated 5XX Error Rate for REST API 
        DESCRIPTION: [AWS] API Gateway Elevated 5XX Error Rate for REST API 
        SEVERITY: critical
        TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-09T08:53:14Z
        
        ANALYSIS:
        {
    "root_cause_summary": "The campaign-api service is experiencing consistent database connection errors, resulting in HTTP 500 responses for the /test-db-connection-error endpoint.",
    
    "detailed_analysis": "The logs show a pattern of database connection errors occurring in the campaign-api service. Each request to the /test-db-connection-error endpoint results in a 500 Internal Server Error with a specific error message indicating 'DatabaseConnectionError: Simulated database connection error'. The errors are consistent and occur with response times between 31-64ms. The error pattern suggests this might be a simulated test scenario or a systematic database connectivity issue.",
    
    "timeline": [
        "2025-07-09T08:33:49Z - Initial series of database connection errors begin",
        "2025-07-09T08:41:00Z - Continued database connection errors with similar pattern",
        "2025-07-09T08:52:53Z - Multiple database connection errors leading to alert trigger",
        "2025-07-09T08:53:14Z - PagerDuty alert triggered for elevated 5XX error rate"
    ],
    
    "contributing_factors": [
        "Database connection failures occurring consistently",
        "Requests specifically targeting a test endpoint (/test-db-connection-error)",
        "Multiple repeated requests from the same client IP (10.0.1.242)",
        "Consistent error pattern with similar response times (~32ms)"

    "log_evidence": [
        "[48c31e44-5337-4965-87bd-ac14ef0b4020] [HTTP 500] DatabaseConnectionError: Simulated database connection error",
        "10.0.1.242 - \"GET /test-db-connection-error HTTP/1.1\" 500 - 32.92ms",
        "INFO:     10.0.1.242:19450 - \"GET /test-db-connection-error HTTP/1.1\" 500 Internal Server Error"
    ],
    
    "recommendations": [
        "Investigate if this is an intended test scenario or a real database connection issue",
        "If test scenario, consider implementing a separate testing environment to avoid triggering production alerts",
        "If real issue, check database connection pool settings and network connectivity",
        "Review alert thresholds for test endpoints to prevent false positives",
        "Implement circuit breaker pattern for database connections if not already in place"
    ],
    
    "confidence_level": "high"
}

The analysis shows a clear and consistent pattern of database connection errors, with high confidence in the root cause due to the explicit error messages and consistent behavior across multiple requests. The fact that this is happening on a test endpoint suggests this might be an intended test scenario rather than a production issue, but it's still triggering production monitoring alerts.
